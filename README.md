# ML Prague 2023: Gaussian process regression when it comes to numerical simulators

While numerical simulators are often used by heavy industries to model complicated phenomenons their complexity makes them sometimes slow and harder to exploit. Gaussian process regression (GPR) provides an accurate framework where based on a limited amount of calls to the simulator one can have a prediction on any of the simulator's output together with confidence bounds. GPR can then be extended to solve optimization and sensitivity analysis tasks with a parsimonious approach. In this workshop the attendants will be given a walk through the basics of GPR in Python.
